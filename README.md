## EarnWeb3DAO Blogs

#

## Concept

Designed so that anyone can mint an NFT with a meta scheme as follows:

<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Content</li>
<li>Img (secondary image displayed along side the Content for example)</li>
<li>Image (Image displayed on marketplaces)</li>
</ul>
The NFT will show a preview of the content on marketplaces and the full content can be rendered elsewhere or viewed directly interacting with the contract. The content can be formatted to fit within the marketplace preview image as the content can be HTML and will display as such on the marketplace. 
<br/> <br/>
The idea is that the blogs can be collated on a UI (which I'll build as part of another EarnWeb3DAO Bounty) and can be used or viewed as a forum of sorts that EW3D members can post their findings and or jest with other members via discussions or showcasing different use case examples.

# Built With

# Deployed With

```
Thirdweb
```

# Contract Address

```
0x41c03e507d4Ba215DC0A54ea3D7C7B6d0cc04f4f
```

# User Instructions

```
Set Title
Set Description
Set Content*
Set Tags

Mint()
```

- The content needn't be HTML but is advised to be
- The Image must be an IPFS hash such as - 'ipfs://QmVMZgbvGcsouoEyzYHHD7WnE2W3fFv1jptPv2peszikMY/EW3D_logo.jpg'

# What's to come?

- I'll repurpose the UI I created for this project when I created it for single user only.
- The UI will auto format text into HTML
- The UI will use Thirdweb for decentralized storage of the Image and metadata
- The UI will display all known NFT(posts) showcasing the metadata and owner
